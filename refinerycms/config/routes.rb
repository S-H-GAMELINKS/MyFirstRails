  # This line mounts Refinery's routes at the root of your application.
  # This means, any requests to the root URL of your application will go to Refinery::PagesController#home.
  # If you would like to change where this extension is mounted, simply change the
  # configuration option `mounted_path` to something different in config/initializers/refinery/core.rb

  # We ask that you don't use the :as option here, as Refinery relies on it being the default of "refinery"
